                How to Choose the Right Alcohol Substitute:
                To keep your recipe as close to the original as possible, consider what function the alcohol serves in the recipe:
                
                If it's being used as a meat tenderizer or marinade, choose soda, sparkling juice, an acidic fruit juice or vinegar as a replacement
                If it's being used for flavor, choose the substitute with the closest flavor match
                If it's being used for its yeast content (i.e., to make bread rise), in an alcoholic beverage or to make flambé, your best bet is to choose a different recipe, since there aren't suitable substitutes for those situations</p>
